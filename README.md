# A Simple Python Package To Replace Words In a Sentence

This package takes a single sentence as an input parameter and returns a sentence with each word replaced by a word of the same length with the same starting letter. The list of available words can be found at http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt.

## Requirements
* Python 3 installed on the device
* A terminal to call the python file

## How to execute the file
* Clone this repository
* Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project (_/ScrabbleAlgorithm_)
* Execute the file with the following command - python3 wordFinder.py "hello you there"
* The sentence "Hello you there" can be replaced with any other sentence containing words of length greater than 1 and less than 22.
* The output will be a simple printed line containing a sentence of the same length with replaced words e.g hooky yep tempo
